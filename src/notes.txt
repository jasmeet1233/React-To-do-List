there are no siblings, child elemts in ract, if you want to edit/delete stuff , see what are u sharing , like a deletehandler button inside a <li>, where you want to delete the <li> text, so you see the what are you sharing, usually we map the objects data, and that data is linked to an id, so we can use that.


now functions, when you create a function, se that you dont put like, obj.name, cause functions anywhere are a separate piece, they are isolated, 
so function ko kisse bhi link mat karr, wahi ka argument use karr, wahi ya toh ek object/variable bana, usko use karr

simple rules,

If you are channging somethig in the list, you have to map again and change the state again , to see the changes, So mapping again will come into picture

If you are updating 2 things at once and they are connected , you can use an obj


cut transition css
add icons.
drag and drop functionality to reorder lists.
